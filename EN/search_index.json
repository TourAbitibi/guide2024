We are very proud of our cycling event, the only one in its category in North America! Its longevity is due to the passion, enthusiasm and unconditional commitment of the Témiscabitibians! For its 54th edition, the Tour will welcome young cyclists from all over the world. As in previous years, team fans can watch the races live on our website at www.tourabitibi.com. I would like to acknowledge the indispensable work of our many volunteers and our permanent team, who worked throughout the year to offer you a most memorable event during the week of the Tour in Amos. In addition, I would like to make a special mention to our faithful and generous partners, without whom the event would not take place, not to mention our current partner, Glencore. On behalf of myself and all those involved in the success of this sporting event, I would like to thank the cyclists and their companions for travelling to Abitibi-Timiskaming. To all of you, I wish you the best of luck, and that the visit to our beautiful region will forever be remembered. Mélanie Rocher Chairwoman of the board Tour Cycliste de l’Abitibi inc.
